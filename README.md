# Maze Escaper Scripts

## Description
This is a repository containing the scripts I wrote for my first videogame: Maze Escaper.
This videogame consists in the player trying to find the password randomly
hidden and randomly generated in the randomly generated maze so they can leave it
(once they find both the password AND the exit).

## Builds
The build can be found here: https://efu-gamedev.itch.io/maze-escaper

## Credits.
The game was made by me, Diego Faria.
